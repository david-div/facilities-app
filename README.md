# Facilities-App

This application is dedicated to the people using the facilities at Makers Academy, by making their life easier.
The facilities-app is built with REACT.
Our team has decided to focus on the areas below to improve the quality of everyone at Makers.


#### Temperature
The regulation of the temperature in the building can be a source of frustration. To make it more democratic, the Facilities-App allows users to vote on their ideal temperature.

```
As a user,
so that I can regulate my temperature,
I want to be able to vote on it
```


#### Food stock
Snacks and food are provided at Makers Academy.
Our Facilities-App allows students and staff to vote for their favourite foods: this allows a better tracking of preferences, and allows a better management of the food supplied for students.

```
As a user,
so that I can eat food I like,
I want to be able to vote for a certain kind of food
```
```
As a user,
so that I can say what I like least
I want to be able to vote for my least favourite food
```
```
As a user,
so that I can try new foods,
I want to be able to vote for new/suggested foods
```
